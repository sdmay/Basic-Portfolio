<img class="barrister" src="C:\Users\Me\Basic-Portfolio\assets\images\barrister.png"><p class="me">It's been a fun 31 years on this planet so far.  2016 has definitely been a wild ride.  I had a vasectomy procedure in February(No kids, trying to keep it that way.) Got married in March to a beautiful young woman.  And was (voluntarily) fired in April from my general management postion with a wholesale florist.  I was promoted just last labor day to move to Pennsauken, NJ- right over the bridge from Philadelphia.  I experienced my first true winter as I am born and raised in Florida.  All the yankees said it was a mild winter, with that said, I don't want to experience any harsh winters.  Being a boss is a blast.  The stress is always there and the more money you make, the more responsibility you take.  I wouldn't change the experience for anything, but certainly glad to be out of the chaotic grind of the floral industry and not dealing with anymore "floral emergencies."</p>
